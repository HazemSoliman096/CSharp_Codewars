# Kata 8

## Convert a Boolean to a String

    Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.  
    Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

## Convert number to reversed array of digits

    Convert number to reversed array of digits  
    Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.  

    Example(Input => Output):  
    35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]  
    0 => [0]

## Vectors #1

### Let's make this short!

    Remember, this is a kata which focuses on object oriented programming

    Task: Create a class Vector3D

    Properties: X, Y, Z and Length as double and public scope and accessors

    X, Y and Z will be set by test methods

    Length should only have an get-accessor which calculates the vector's length

    ##Some references, to get into the topic

    The length or magnitude or norm of the vector a is denoted by ‖a‖ or, less commonly, |a|, which is not to be confused with the absolute value (a scalar "norm").

    The length of the vector a can be computed with the Euclidean norm

### Tests

    Final tests include 2 fixed and 125 random tests. They will look like this:
``` CSharp
    double length = new Vector3D()
    {
    X = 0,
    Y = 0,
    Z = 2
    }.Length;
    length == 2 // true
```
